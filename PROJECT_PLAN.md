- **Requirements**: PHP 8.0+ with Composer âœ…

### Current Architecture

```
src/QueryBuilder.php      # Main class with comprehensive functionality
tests/QueryBuilderTest.php # PHPUnit tests covering all scenarios (44 tests)
examples/                 # Sample .gql files and usage scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ user.gql             # Basic query with variables
â”œâ”€â”€ users.gql            # Query with fragment placeholder
â”œâ”€â”€ example.php          # Comprehensive usage demonstration
â””â”€â”€ fluent_example.php   # Fluent API usage examples
```

### Implemented Features

**âœ… Core Query Building:**
- Load from `.gql` files with `loadFromFile()`
- Load from strings with `loadFromString()`
- Full variable definition support with `defineVariable($name, $type, $defaultValue)`
- Variable injection into query operation definitions

**âœ… Advanced Fragment Handling:**
- Safe fragment replacement avoiding comments and string literals
- Nested fragment support with circular dependency detection
- Fragment file imports with `loadFragmentFromFile()`
- Manual fragment definition with `addFragment()`

**âœ… Fluent Query Building API:**
- Operation builders: `query()`, `mutation()`, `subscription()`
- Field builders: `field()`, `object()`, `end()` for nested structures
- Argument support in field and object definitions
- Complete programmatic query construction without `.gql` files

**âœ… Advanced Features:**
- Field aliasing with `addAlias()`
- Directive support with `addDirective()` (@include, @skip)
- Multiple operation support in single requests
- Complex nested object and field building

**âœ… Quality & Testing:**
- Comprehensive test suite (44 tests, 93 assertions, 100% passing)
- Error handling for file operations and malformed queries
- Working examples demonstrating all features

## Development Roadmap

This plan outlines 4 milestones with 8 specific issues to enhance and finalize the GraphQL Query Builder project. **Note: Most core features described in the original plan are already implemented and working.**

## ðŸ”„ **REMAINING WORK** 

## Milestone 1 â€“ Code Quality and Standards

**Goal**: Enhance code quality and establish development standards

### Issue #1: Introduce PSR-12 Coding Standards
- **Problem**: No automated code style checking
- **Solution**: Add PHP CodeSniffer or PHP CS Fixer to enforce PSR-12 standards
- **Impact**: Consistent code style and improved maintainability
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Add coding standard tool to composer.json dev dependencies
  - Configure PSR-12 ruleset
  - Fix any existing style violations
  - Add composer script for style checking and fixing

### Issue #2: Add Static Analysis Tools
- **Problem**: No static analysis for type safety and potential bugs
- **Solution**: Integrate PHPStan or Psalm for static analysis
- **Impact**: Early detection of type errors and potential issues
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Add PHPStan to dev dependencies
  - Configure analysis level and rules
  - Fix any detected issues
  - Add composer script for analysis

---

## Milestone 2 â€“ Enhanced Documentation

**Goal**: Provide comprehensive documentation for easy adoption

### Issue #3: Expand README with Complete API Documentation
- **Problem**: Basic README doesn't document all implemented features
- **Solution**: Create comprehensive API documentation with examples
- **Impact**: Better adoption and easier onboarding for new users
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Document all public methods with PHPDoc-style examples
  - Add installation and quick start guide
  - Include fluent API examples
  - Document variable definitions, fragments, aliases, and directives
  - Add troubleshooting section

### Issue #4: Create Advanced Usage Examples
- **Problem**: Limited examples showing library's full capabilities
- **Solution**: Add more comprehensive example files
- **Impact**: Clear demonstration of advanced features
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Add mutation examples with complex inputs
  - Show subscription usage patterns
  - Demonstrate error handling scenarios
  - Add real-world usage examples (e.g., pagination, filtering)

---

## Milestone 3 â€“ Enhanced Validation and Error Handling

**Goal**: Improve robustness and developer experience

### Issue #5: GraphQL Syntax Validation
- **Problem**: No validation of GraphQL syntax when loading queries
- **Solution**: Integrate GraphQL parser for syntax validation
- **Impact**: Better error messages and early detection of malformed queries
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Consider integrating `webonyx/graphql-php` for parsing
  - Validate syntax when loading from files or strings
  - Provide clear error messages for syntax issues
  - Add tests for various error scenarios

### Issue #6: Enhanced Error Messages and Logging
- **Problem**: Basic error messages could be more helpful
- **Solution**: Improve exception messages and add optional logging
- **Impact**: Better debugging experience for developers
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Enhance error messages with context and suggestions
  - Add optional PSR-3 compatible logging
  - Improve file operation error handling
  - Add debug mode for detailed information

---

## Milestone 4 â€“ Release and Distribution

**Goal**: Prepare for stable release and Packagist publication

### Issue #7: Finalize Composer Package Metadata
- **Problem**: Basic composer.json needs enhancement for publication
- **Solution**: Add complete metadata for Packagist publication
- **Impact**: Professional package ready for distribution
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Add keywords, description, and author information
  - Add homepage and repository URLs
  - Configure proper version constraints
  - Add suggest section for optional dependencies
  - Prepare CHANGELOG.md

### Issue #8: Continuous Integration Setup

- **Impact**: Ensure compatibility and quality across PHP versions
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Create workflow testing PHP 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3
  - Run PHPUnit tests on all versions
  - Run coding standards and static analysis checks
  - Add status badges to README
