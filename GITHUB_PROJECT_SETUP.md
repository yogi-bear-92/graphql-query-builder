# GitHub Project Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the complete project structure in GitHub based on the PROJECT_PLAN.md.

## 📋 Overview

This repository includes ready-to-use GitHub issue templates for all 13 issues across 6 milestones. The templates are located in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` and can be used to quickly populate your GitHub project.

## 📝 Creating Issues from Templates

### Option 1: Using GitHub Templates (Recommended)
1. Go to your repository's Issues section
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Select "Get started" next to the appropriate template
4. The title, labels, and content will be pre-filled
5. Assign to the appropriate milestone
6. Submit the issue

### Option 2: Manual Creation
If templates aren't working, copy the content from each template file:

1. Go to Issues → New Issue
2. Copy the title from the template (without the `---` front matter)
3. Copy the body content (everything after the second `---`)
4. Add the labels manually: `enhancement`, `core`, `milestone-1` (etc.)
5. Assign to the appropriate milestone

## 🏷️ Issue Labels to Create

Create these labels in your repository (Settings → Labels):

### By Type
- `enhancement` (green) - New features or improvements
- `documentation` (blue) - Documentation improvements  
- `testing` (yellow) - Test-related changes
- `release` (red) - Release preparation tasks
- `validation` (orange) - Validation and error handling

### By Area
- `core` (purple) - Core functionality changes
- `api` (teal) - API design and fluent interface
- `examples` (light blue) - Example files and scripts
- `quality` (dark green) - Code quality improvements
- `packaging` (brown) - Package management and distribution

### By Milestone
- `milestone-1` through `milestone-6` (gray)

## 📊 Project Board Setup (Optional)

Create a project board to track progress:

1. Go to Projects → New Project → Board
2. Name it "GraphQL Query Builder Development"
3. Add columns:
   - 📋 **Backlog** (All unassigned issues)
   - 🏗️ **In Progress** (Currently being worked on)
   - 👀 **Review** (Ready for review)
   - ✅ **Done** (Completed)

## 🔄 Issue Creation Order

Create issues in this order to maintain proper dependencies:

1. **Milestone 1** (Issues #1-3): Core features that everything builds on
2. **Milestone 2** (Issues #4-5): Advanced API features
3. **Milestone 3** (Issues #6-7): Quality improvements
4. **Milestone 4** (Issues #8-9): Documentation
5. **Milestone 5** (Issues #10-11): Testing and standards
6. **Milestone 6** (Issues #12-13): Release preparation
