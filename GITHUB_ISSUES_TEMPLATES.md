- Consider adding psalm as alternative/additional tool

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] All current code passes static analysis
- [ ] Document analysis process for contributors
- [ ] Add baseline file if needed for gradual adoption

## Documentation Updates
- [ ] Add static analysis instructions to development docs

### Issue #4: Create Advanced Usage Examples

**Title**: [Documentation] Create Advanced Usage Examples

**Labels**: documentation, examples, milestone-2

**Body**:
```markdown
## Problem Description
Current examples are basic and don't showcase the full capabilities of the library, particularly advanced features like complex mutations, error handling, and real-world patterns.

## Proposed Solution
Add comprehensive example files demonstrating advanced usage patterns and real-world scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Add mutation examples with complex input types
- [ ] Show subscription usage patterns  
- [ ] Demonstrate error handling scenarios

- [ ] Show integration with popular GraphQL endpoints
- [ ] Add performance optimization examples
- [ ] Include examples for different architectural patterns

## Implementation Notes
- Create separate example files for different scenarios
- Use realistic data structures and operations
- Include both success and error cases

## Milestone 3 - Enhanced Validation and Error Handling

### Issue #5: GraphQL Syntax Validation

**Title**: [Enhancement] GraphQL Syntax Validation

**Labels**: enhancement, validation, milestone-3

**Body**:
```markdown
## Problem Description

Integrate GraphQL parser for syntax validation with clear error messages.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Validate GraphQL syntax when loading from files or strings
- [ ] Provide clear error messages for syntax issues
- [ ] Add optional strict mode for enhanced validation
